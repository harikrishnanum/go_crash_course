This is a basic example of a Go programming language code.

In this code, we have defined a function named "main". When you run the Go program, the code execution starts with the "main" function. Within the main function, we are using the "fmt" package to print "Hello World" on the standard output.

The "fmt" package is one of the built-in packages of the Go programming language, which provides a variety of functions to format and output data.

`package main`

- In Go programming language, the package main statement is a special declaration that indicates that the current Go file belongs to the main package
- The main package is the entry point for any Go program that is intended to be executed as a standalone application. When you build or run a Go program, the Go compiler looks for the main package and executes the main function within that package.
- The main function is required in the main package, and it serves as the starting point of the program. It is the first function that gets executed when the program runs. Any code inside the main function will be executed sequentially.
