In Go, `sync.WaitGroup` is a struct type that provides a simple way to synchronize the execution of multiple Goroutines. It allows a Goroutine to wait for a collection of other Goroutines to complete their execution before continuing.

`WaitGroup` is used when we want to wait for a group of Goroutines to complete their execution before proceeding with the rest of the program. The WaitGroup is initialized with a counter, which is incremented every time a new Goroutine is spawned. When a Goroutine completes its execution, it decrements the counter. The WaitGroup blocks the main Goroutine until the counter reaches zero.

Here's an example of how to use `WaitGroup` in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(id int) {
			fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d executing\n", id)
            time.Sleep(time.Second)
			wg.Done()
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("All Goroutines completed")
}
```

In this example, we create a `WaitGroup` variable `wg`. We then start 5 Goroutines inside a loop, and for each Goroutine, we increment the WaitGroup counter using the `Add` method. Inside each Goroutine, we print a message indicating that it is executing and then call the `Done` method to decrement the WaitGroup counter. Finally, we call the `Wait` method on the WaitGroup to block the main Goroutine until all the Goroutines have completed their execution.

When we run this program, we will see the messages printed by the Goroutines, followed by the message "All Goroutines completed". The WaitGroup ensures that the main Goroutine does not exit before all the spawned Goroutines have completed their execution.

In summary, `sync.WaitGroup` is a useful synchronization primitive in Go that allows us to wait for a group of Goroutines to complete their execution before continuing with the rest of the program.

Although `WaitGroup` is a useful synchronization primitive in Go, it has some potential issues and pitfalls that developers should be aware of:

1. Deadlocks: If the number of Goroutines we are waiting for is incorrect, or if there is a mistake in the way we increment or decrement the counter, it can cause the program to deadlock. In this case, the program will hang and not complete its execution.

2. Use with caution: We should use `WaitGroup` with caution because it can cause performance issues in some cases. If we are waiting for a large number of Goroutines to complete, it can lead to a large number of blocked threads, which can cause performance issues.

3. Limited functionality: `WaitGroup` provides only basic functionality for synchronizing Goroutines. For more complex synchronization scenarios, we may need to use other synchronization primitives such as channels, mutexes, or semaphores.

4. No timeout mechanism: `WaitGroup` does not provide a built-in mechanism for setting a timeout. If we need to wait for Goroutines to complete for a limited amount of time, we need to implement a timeout mechanism ourselves.

In summary, while `WaitGroup` is a useful synchronization primitive, we should use it with caution and be aware of its potential issues and limitations. It is also important to understand its usage and behavior to avoid common pitfalls.
