In Go, web development is primarily done using the standard library's `net/http` package, which provides functions for handling HTTP requests and responses. 

The `net/http` package provides an `http.Server` type that can listen for incoming requests, parse them, and route them to appropriate handlers. 

Go also has a number of third-party web frameworks and libraries available, such as Gin, Echo, and Revel, which provide additional features and abstractions for building web applications.

Some key features of web development in Go include:

1. **Fast and efficient**: Go is a compiled language, which makes it fast and efficient for building web applications.

2. **Concurrency**: Go's built-in concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels, make it easy to write highly concurrent web applications.

3. **Easy to learn and use**: Go's simple syntax and minimalistic design make it easy to learn and use, especially for developers coming from languages like C, Java, or Python.

4. **Scalability**: Go's built-in support for concurrency and networking make it well-suited for building scalable web applications.

Overall, Go is a great language for building web applications, with its fast performance, built-in concurrency features, and simple syntax making it a popular choice for many developers.
