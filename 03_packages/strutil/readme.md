This Go function `Reverse` takes a string as an input and returns the reversed version of the same string. Here's how it works:

1. Convert the string to a slice of runes, which is the equivalent of a character array in Go.
```
runes := []rune(s)
```

2. Reverse the slice of runes by swapping the first and last elements, the second and second-to-last elements, and so on, using a `for` loop with two variables `i` and `j`.
```
for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
	runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]
}
```

3. Convert the reversed slice of runes back to a string and return it.
```
return string(runes)
```

Here's an example of using this function:

```
func main() {
	s := "Hello, world!"
	reversed := Reverse(s)
	fmt.Println(reversed) // Output: "!dlrow ,olleH"
}
```

The output will be the reversed string "!dlrow ,olleH".
