In Go, an array is a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type, while a slice is a dynamically sized and more flexible version of an array. 

Arrays in Go are declared with a fixed size and cannot be resized later. The syntax for declaring an array is as follows:

```
var myArray [5]int // an array of 5 integers
```

Here, we declare an array of integers with 5 elements. Each element is of type int, and the array can only store 5 integer values.

Slices, on the other hand, are created using an array as the underlying structure but allow for dynamic resizing. The syntax for declaring a slice is as follows:

```
var mySlice []int // a slice of integers
```

Here, we declare a slice of integers, but we don't specify a size. This means that the slice can dynamically adjust its size as we add or remove elements.

To create a slice from an existing array, we can use the slice operator `myArray[startIndex:endIndex]`. This creates a new slice that references the elements of the original array from `startIndex` up to, but not including, `endIndex`.

For example:

```
myArray := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
mySlice := myArray[1:4] // a slice containing {2, 3, 4}
```

Slices have some additional features compared to arrays. For example, you can use the built-in `append` function to add new elements to a slice. You can also use the `make` function to create a slice with a specified size and capacity.

```
mySlice := make([]int, 5, 10) // a slice of integers with length 5 and capacity 10
```

In summary, arrays have a fixed size and cannot be resized, while slices have a dynamic size and can be resized. Slices are built on top of arrays and provide more flexibility for working with sequences of elements.

Some of the basic functions for arrays and slices in Go:

**Arrays:**

1. `len(arr [n]T) int`: Returns the length of the array.
2. `arr1 == arr2`: Compares two arrays for equality.
3. `var arr [n]T`: Declares an array of n elements of type T.
4. `arr[index]`: Accesses the value at the given index of the array.

**Slices:**

1. `len(slice) int`: Returns the length of the slice.
2. `cap(slice) int`: Returns the capacity of the slice.
3. `append(slice []T, elems ...T) []T`: Appends the given elements to the end of the slice and returns the new slice.
4. `copy(dest []T, src []T) int`: Copies elements from the source slice to the destination slice and returns the number of elements copied.
5. `slice[low:high]`: Returns a slice of the given slice, starting from the low index up to but not including the high index.
6. `slice[low:]`: Returns a slice of the given slice, starting from the low index to the end of the slice.
7. `slice[:high]`: Returns a slice of the given slice, from the beginning of the slice up to but not including the high index.
8. `var slice []T`: Declares a slice of elements of type T.

Note that slices are a dynamic data structure in Go, while arrays have a fixed size. Slices can be resized, while arrays cannot.
